# DriveSSL 🚗🧠  
Self-Supervised and Multi-Task Learning on BDD100K

DriveSSL is a deep learning research project focused on learning robust visual representations for autonomous driving scenarios using the BDD100K dataset.

The project follows a staged learning strategy:
1. Self-supervised pretraining using SimCLR
2. Supervised multi-head classification (weather, scene, time-of-day)
3. Linear evaluation and fine-tuning
4. Detailed error analysis using confusion matrices

The goal is to analyze representation quality, task interference, and failure modes in real-world driving data.
